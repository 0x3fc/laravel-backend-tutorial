# 1. Create Laravel Project

## Install Composer

Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for creating Laravel project.

```bash
$ php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
$ php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '544e09ee996cdf60ece3804abc52599c22b1f40f4323403c44d44fdfdd586475ca9813a858088ffbc1f233e9b180f061') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
$ php composer-setup.php
$ php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

See [Download Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

<summary>more about Composer</summary>

Composer is a PHP dependency manager, just like npm or pypi.

## Create Laravel project

Then, use the following command to create a new Laravel project.

In this example, we are making a house posts collection page named `van-house`.

```bash
$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel van-house-backend # van-house-backend is the project name
```

See [Laravel Installation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation)

## Set env

When project is created, a `.env` file will also be created. If it is not been created, copy 
[.env.example](../.env.example) file and name it `.env`.

Fill out database settings in `.env` (assuming you are using localhost in testing).

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=<database-name>
DB_USERNAME=<user-name>
DB_PASSWORD=<user-password>
```
